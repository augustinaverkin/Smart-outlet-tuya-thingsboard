Read data from smart outlet, connect smart outlets to tuya cloud, create thingsboard cloud data visualisation, connect real time electricity prices. System is created for following energy usage around house, wirelessly turning outlets off and on, connecting electricity usage to real time electricity prices.

This is some code examples about how to connect different brand smart outlets (Nous, Tuya...) to one system, read data from them using Tuya cloud, send data to Thingsboard cloud and create local and thingsboard visualisation.

Note! You will need to create Tuya Iot platform to connect all smart outlets and Thingsboard cloud platform to create data visualisation.
